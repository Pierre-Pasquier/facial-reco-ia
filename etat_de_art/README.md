### YOLO

https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

YOLO is a text configuration file defining how neural networks are built and behave. YOLOv4 is the most recent version of YOLO. YOLOv4-tiny is a smaller/faster version of YOLOv4. It is possible to train a YOLO model to detect custom objects, using the pre-trained weights-files.
